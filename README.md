# Open Water Detector

A Fabric mod to inform the user whether they are fishing in open water.

## How to set up

Place the downloaded jar into your **mods** folder inside your Minecraft instance.

In order to find the location of your Minecraft instance:
- **Normal launcher** - Any of the following:
  - `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`
  - `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`
- **MultiMC** - Follow the steps:
  1. **Right-Click** on your instance
  2. Select **"Minecraft Folder"**

## Behavior

Whenever your fishing bobber is inside a body of water, particles will spawn around it:
- **green** particles when the bobber is in _open water_
- **flame** particles when it isn't

The [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing#Junk_and_treasure) defines _open water_ as:
> the 5×4×5 vicinity around the bobber resting on the water surface (2 blocks away horizontally,
> 2 blocks above the water surface, and 2 blocks deep). Each horizontal layer in this area must consist only of air and
> lily pads or water source blocks, waterlogged blocks without collision (such as signs, kelp, or coral),
> and bubble columns.

## Keybind

The mod can be toggled **ON** and **OFF** through the use of the **Toggle Detector** keybind in the
**Open Water Detector** section (Default: **O**).
**Keep in mind that the mod will be ON by default whenever you start your game.**
